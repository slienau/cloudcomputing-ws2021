CPU: The results were as expected. Pure CPU performance is quite high in KVM as HW-assisted Virt. as not as much traps and emulation is needed. Docker is even faster here as the containers are more lightweight compared to system-virt. QEMU is really slow, as emulation takes a lot of CPU-cycles to be done.
Memory: The results are parallel to CPU. We would expect higher performance with docker as it is very lightweight and can use system resources with low level handling. KVM performance is also quite good as EPT/NPT tech is enabled in HW-level enables quick accessing. QEMU is really slow as additional memory access can cause significant perf. decrease.
RandDisk: We would have expected the same ranking here, too. But KVM and QEMU seems to be faster in diskRank, we are not sure quite how this happens but some caching of storage on memory can cause this. Native and Docker are quite close to each other.
SeqDisk: The results are as expected. Docker and native are quite close as docker is mounting storage from the system to the container. KVM is slower as VMM intervention is required and QEMU is the slowest due to no HW support.
Fork: Native, docker and KVM are really close here, as priveledge instructions can be handled efficiently by containers and HW-assisted. QEMU is way slower, as emulation takes a lot of cycles.
Uplink: docker uses nat for networking and kvm uses virtual network and nat, qemu is emulated so it's the slowest.
